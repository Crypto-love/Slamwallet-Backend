    <h2>A THANK YOU LETTER TO OUR COMMUNITY</h2>

    <p>Hello SlamFam.</p> 
    <p>We would like to send our warmest regards and gratitude to all our community of investors following a successful record breaking fund raising campaign all thanks to your continued patronage. </p>

    <p>The Slamchat App provides an online platform for content creators and fans to buy sell mint and collect content NFTs. Essentially, the NFT is the central feature of the Slamchat trading NFT and users willing to make transactions will be required to be registered on SLAMCHAT, in which the utility tokens used for all transactions are $SLM. </p>

    <p>By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, which fosters decentralization (web 3.0) and tokenization, the goal is to integrate the NFT marketplace to social media platforms, thus providing social media users and companies the opportunity to create additional sources of income through monetization of content, as well as creating a system that facilitates interactions with audiences.</p>

    <p>By engaging in our community, SLAMCHAT eliminates the need for middlemen and intermediaries who are entitled to a cut of the creators’ revenue. The implication is that creators are able to boost the value of content, in addition to gaining the freedom to grow their audiences without limitations. </p>

    <p>In order to optimize user experience and ensure future continuity of service provision, we have made it possible for $SLM token holders to be actively involved in the SLAMCHAT ecosystem’s policy-making process. To this end, the more the $SLM a user holds, the more the voting power. This is in addition to the myriad protections and access to rights that holders are entitled to within the SLAMCHAT ecosystem. </p>

    <p>Social tokens provide our community with the ability to enjoy several perks. For instance, SLAMCHAT buyers will enjoy incentives including special access to exclusive content and a percentage of the creator’s NFT sales in addition to cost reductions and increased visibility for their listings.</p>

    <p>We are consolidating and capitalizing SLAMCHAT efforts on social media-related goods. Social media is crucial to content creation and as such, our goal is to create a platform where fast actors can take advantage  of the expansive market potential.</p>

    <p>As we move towards the development of a creators’ economy 2.0, we anticipate challenges along the way, but we are confident that with decentralization comes collaboration and as more creators emerge, so will buyers and fans. This implies that more content creators will outperform themselves as more buyers and fans seek new experiences. </p>

    <p>Finally, to all the investors that were involved in round one raising of funds, “Thank you” for believing in our vision. We continually remain dedicated to the improvement of key areas of the SlamNFT ecosystem and we aim to periodically provide our investors with reports showcasing roadmaps and milestones.  </p>

    <p>We are thankful for your continued patronage and patience as we work towards a mission of integrating NFT marketplace and social media to transform the NFT business. </p>

    <p>In regards,</p>
    <p>SlamChat Team.</p>
